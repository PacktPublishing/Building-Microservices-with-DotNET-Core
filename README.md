This is the code repository for [Building Microservices with .NET Core](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/building-microservices-net-core?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785887833), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Distributed systems are always difficult to get complete success with. Lately, microservices have been getting considerable attention. With Netflix and Spotify, microservices implementations have some of the biggest success stories in the industry. Microservices is quickly gaining popularity and acceptance with enterprise architects. On the other hand, there is another camp that thinks microservices as nothing new or only as a rebranding of SOA.

In any case, microservices architecture has critical advantages, particularly with regard to empowering the nimble improvement and conveyance of complex venture applications.

However, there is no clear practical advice on how to implement microservices in the Microsoft ecosystem and especially with taking advantage of Azure and the .NET Core framework.

This book tries to fill that void. It explores the concepts, challenges, and strengths of planning, constructing, and operating microservices architectures built with .NET Core. This book discusses all cross-cutting concerns, along with the microservices design. It also highlights the more important aspects to consider while building and operating microservices through practical how tos and best practices for security, monitoring, and scalability.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
 namespace FlixOne.BookStore.ProductService.Models
    {
      public class Category
      {
        public Guid Id { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string Description { get; set; }
       }
    }
```

All supporting code samples in this book are tested on .NET Core 1.1, using Visual Studio 2015 update 3 as IDE and SQL Server 2008R2 as database on the Windows platform.
